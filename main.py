from src.game_runner.round import Round

# todo 1 play some normal rounds to look for bugs

# todo 2 write tests (can't cover anything though, it's impossible - maybe some logic fns and tile.py fns)

# todo 3 - install.md/readme.md for installing on other computers?

# todo 4 - check for type hints for every function

# todo 5 remove unnecessary prints and uncalled functions
